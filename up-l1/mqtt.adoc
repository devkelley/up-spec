== Overview

MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. MQTT today is used in a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, oil and gas, etc

For more information, please refer to https://mqtt.org/

== Specifications

=== UAttribute Mapping

MQTT 5 supports custom header fields, and we leverage this to map the UAttribute values into the MQTT header.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| MQTT Header Property Code | Value (key:value)
| UserProperty
| ("1", "{UAttribute.id}") # UUID id
| UserProperty
| ("2", "{UAttribute.type}") # UMessageType
| UserProperty
| ("3","{UAttribute.source}") # Short Form Serialized Source UURI
| UserProperty
| ("4","{UAttribute.sink}") # Short Form Serialized Sink UURI
| UserProperty
| ("5","{UAttribute.priority}") # UPriority
| UserProperty
| ("6", "{UAttribute.ttl}") # Optional ttl
| UserProperty
| ("7", "{UAttribute.permissionLevel}") # Optional permission level
| UserProperty
| ("8", "{UAttribute.commStatus}") # Optional UCode commstatus
| UserProperty
| ("9", "{UAttribute.reqId}") # UUID reqid
| UserProperty
| ("10", "{UAttribute.token}") # Optional token
| UserProperty
| ("11", "{UAttribute.traceParent}") # Optional traceparent
|===

All uAttributes are mapped to a MQTT header UserProperty, where the key is the UAttribute protobuf field number.

The source and sink fields **MUST** be link:../basics/uri.adoc[Short URI Format].

The type field is used by a UListener to select message types on the topic.

=== URI Mapping

The URI mapping follows the short form UUri format, with the addition of a location identifier to determine if the message is intended for a local or cloud destination.

- `{UUri.UAuthority.number}/{UUri.UEntity.id}/{UUri.UEntity.version_major}/{UUri.UResource.id}`

  Note: If the UUri does not contain a UAuthority, add the UAuthority.number for the UAuthority the transport client is running on.

Subscribe to all messages to the current Authority

- `{UUri.UAuthority.number}/+/+/+` where `UAttributes.type != Publish`

Subscribe to all messages from a different Authority

- `{UUri.UAuthority.number}/+/+/+` where `UAttributes.type == Publish`

When sending a message, the source UUri is used for Publish message types and sink UUri is used for all other message types.

Examples:

[source]
----
UUri {
  authority: UAuthority {
    name: "Vehicle_1",
    number: 192.168.0.0,
  },
  entity: UEntity {
    name: "body.access",
    version_major: 1,
    id: 1234,
  }
  resource: UResource {
    name: "door",
    instance: "front_left",
    message: "Door",
    id: 5678,
  }
}
----
topic: `192.168.0.0/1234/1/5678`


[source]
----
UUri {
  authority: empty,
  entity: UEntity {
    name: "body.access",
    version_major: 1,
    id: 1234,
  }
  resource: UResource {
    name: "door",
    instance: "front_left",
    message: "Door",
    id: 5678,
  }
}
----

topic: `{current UAuthority}/1234/1/5678`


If a UUri is provided with only a UAuthority we should subscribe to all topics under the UAuthority topic:

[source]
----
UUri {
  authority: UAuthority {
    name: "Vehicle_1",
    number: 192.168.0.0,
  },
  entity: empty,
  resource: empty,
}
----

* If UAuthority matches current UAuthority: `192.168.0.0/+/+/+` where UAttributes.type != Publish.
* If UAuthority does not match current UAuthority: `192.168.0.0/+/+/+` where UAttributes.type == Publish.`

=== Payload Encoding

The MQTT payload **MUST** be a UPayload that is represented as a byte array to reduce size.
