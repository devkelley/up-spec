This folder contains the uProtocol data model (UUri, UAttributes, UMessage, UUID, etc..), and core services definitions (uDiscovery, uSubscription, uTwin), common to all programming languages supported by uProtocol. 

The language specific libraries pull these protos into their respective projects to build and add validators, serializers, and factory/builder functionality specific to their programming language.
